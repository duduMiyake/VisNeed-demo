## About <a name = "about"></a>

VisNeed is an interactive platform designed to make the decision tree editor NEED, developed
by Barbosa and Rodrigues (2025), more accessible and user-friendly for a broader audience,
particularly for users without a background in computing. While NEED provides a formal
and robust editor for defining, modifying, and exporting decision trees in standardized formats,
VisNeed aims to complement these functionalities by acting as a more intuitive and easy-to-use
visualizer and editor. One of the key objectives of VisNeed is to facilitate the adoption of NEED
by combining advanced visualization, interactivity, and customization practices. Additionally,
it seeks to support various modeling scenarios, such as gameplay design in digital games and
interactive applications, thereby extending its utility to researchers and developers. Inheriting
structural characteristics from NEED, VisNeed will enable integration with game engines and
other computational platforms, offering greater practicality and flexibility in the creation and use
of decision trees.
